- Our free topic is conducting offensive language detection on a set of 100 tweets from the daily trending hashtags dynamically. This is an interesting topic because it allows us to sense whether the most supposedly relevant tweets can be characterized with polite, impolite, offensive, and non-offensive language. This can allow us to find certain patterns and sentiments in the trending hashtags, which can help us identify how people feel about popular discussions and how polarized specific topics on Twitter are. We plan to use Tweepy, the Python library for accessing the Twitter API, to fetch our 100 tweets. Then, we will build a system that classifies the tweets. When analyzing our data, we will experiment with different classifiers and evaluate our system using the standard classification evaluations metrics (Precision, Recall, and F-score). The expected outcome is to display our results on a web app that we create using React.

Which programming language do you plan to use?
- Python, Java, Javascript
